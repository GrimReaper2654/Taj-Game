    <h1>The Henry Game</h1>
    
    <p id="text">With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,<br>
        England mourns for her dead across the sea.<br>
        Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,<br>
        Fallen in the cause of the free.<br><br>
        
        Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal<br>
        Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres,<br>
        There is music in the midst of desolation<br>
        And a glory that shines upon our tears.<br><br>
        
        They went with songs to the battle, they were young,<br>
        Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.<br>
        They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;<br>
        They fell with their faces to the foe.<br><br>
        
        They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:<br>
        Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>
        At the going down of the sun and in the morning<br>
        We will remember them.<br><br>
        
        
        They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;<br>
        They sit no more at familiar tables of home;<br>
        They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;<br>
        They sleep beyond Englandâ€™s foam.<br><br>
        
        But where our desires are and our hopes profound,<br>
        Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,<br>
        To the innermost heart of their own land they are known<br>
        As the stars are known to the Night;<br><br>
        
        As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,<br>
        Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;<br>
        As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,<br>
        To the end, to the end, they remain.<br><br><br></p>
